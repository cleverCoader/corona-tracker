This project is a 'Corona tracker' 
it gives statistics regarding currently active total cases and also a data of each and every(188 ) countries 

I have used react library for the project and also used many tools like

1) materialUI,
2) chart.js, react-chartjs-2 (for Line and bar charts ),
3) countUp, 
4) classnames, etc
5) axios for fetching data from API

API used is: "https://covid19.mathdro.id/api"
